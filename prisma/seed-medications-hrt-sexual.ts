const TC_INJECTION_RX = `Men's Hormone Replacement Therapy
Hormone Replacement Therapy Treatment:
Patient to monitor and record weekly blood pressure and heart rate for review at follow up. If blood pressure is consistently >150/90 or there are any notable side effects or concerns such as lumps/tenderness in the testicles, severe acne, oily skin, difficulty urinating, thinning hair, worsening fatigue, breast enlargement or tenderness, increased moodiness, etc., patient is to discontinue use of testosterone therapy and follow up with their OptimaleMD-affiliated physician for further evaluation and treatment.
Follow up labs and telemedicine consult in approximately 3 months. Labs to be drawn as instructed in email to follow. Care team will arrange subsequent lab testing and follow ups. If follow up labs are abnormal, repeat labs per company protocol prior to follow up consultation.
Testosterone Cypionate (200mg/mL): Dispense one month supply with 3 refills and include injection supplies. Discussed with patient injection sites as well as injection methods. Ship directly to the patient's home address unless a local pharmacy is requested.
IM/SQ injections: If the patient is prescribed IM injections and would like to switch to SQ injections or if the patient is prescribed SQ injections and would like to switch to IM injections, our team will modify the patient's next prescription refill to reflect the appropriate needles and syringes per company protocol.
Testosterone Therapy: Reviewed mechanism of action and that through its use, there will be suppression of natural production of testosterone and semen (which may lead to infertility), and may lead to the shrinkage of the testicles. Also discussed that there are no guarantees that natural production of testosterone will return to baseline after stopping therapy. Discussion of the main side effects included: testicular shrinkage, infertility, acne, oily skin, hair loss, mood changes, breast development, deeper voice, hirsutism, lower HDL, stimulation of BPH/malignant prostate issues, elevation in red blood cell production, elevation in estrogen and need for an additional medication/supplement for inhibition.
Contraindications reviewed: known breast or prostate cancer, palpable prostate nodule, PSA >4 ng/mL without urologic evaluation, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, known hypersensitivity, untreated severe sleep apnea, uncontrolled or poorly controlled severe heart failure, active desire for fertility (unless combining therapy with clomiphene citrate), MI within the last 3-6 months. If the criteria for diagnosis of hypogonadism is not achieved (TT <300ng/dL), testosterone will be used "off label" for the symptomatic treatment of low testosterone.`;

Hormone Replacement Therapy Treatment:
Patient to monitor and record weekly blood pressure and heart rate for review at follow up. If blood pressure is consistently >150/90 or there are any notable side effects or concerns, patient is to discontinue use of testosterone therapy and follow up with their OptimaleMD-affiliated physician for further evaluation and treatment.
Follow up labs and telemedicine consult in approximately 3 months.
Testosterone Sublingual Troche: Dispense one month supply with 3 refills. Ship directly to the patient's home address.

const TC_CREAM_RX = `Men's Hormone Replacement Therapy
Hormone Replacement Therapy Treatment:
Patient to monitor and record weekly blood pressure and heart rate for review at follow up. If blood pressure is consistently >150/90 or there are any notable side effects, patient is to discontinue use and follow up with their OptimaleMD-affiliated physician.
Follow up labs and telemedicine consult in approximately 3 months.
Testosterone Cream: Apply 1 mL topically as directed by your physician — dispense one month supply with 3 refills. Application Instructions: apply directly to testicles, inner thighs or over the shoulders and cover with clothing; wash hands thoroughly after application or wear gloves (transference caution required). Ship directly to the patient's home address.
The application of testosterone cream using an ungloved hand may lead to abnormal lab results. Recommend testing at a lab using venipuncture. Labs should be drawn on the same day but prior to cream application.
Testosterone Therapy: Reviewed mechanism of action and main side effects including: testicular shrinkage, infertility, acne, oily skin, hair loss, mood changes, breast development, lower HDL, elevated estrogen.
Contraindications reviewed: known breast or prostate cancer, palpable prostate nodule, PSA >4 ng/mL without urologic evaluation, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, known hypersensitivity, untreated severe sleep apnea, uncontrolled severe heart failure, active desire for fertility, MI within the last 3-6 months.`;

const ENCLOMIPHENE_RX = `Hormone Restoration Therapy Treatment:
Patient educated that enclomiphene stimulates endogenous testosterone via hypothalamic-pituitary axis activation.
Follow-Up: Labs in 6–8 weeks (TT, FT, LH, FSH, estradiol, CBC, CMP). Telemedicine visit after labs for review.
Side Effects Discussed: Headache, visual changes, mood fluctuations, nausea, elevated estradiol, acne.
Contraindications Reviewed: Pregnancy, hormone-sensitive malignancies, hepatic impairment.
Off-Label Disclosure: Used off-label for treatment of functional secondary hypogonadism and fertility preservation.`;

const ANASTROZOLE_RX = `Estrogen Management Therapy:
Anastrozole (Arimidex) is used to manage elevated estrogen levels, typically as adjunct therapy to testosterone replacement.
Follow-Up: Labs in 6–8 weeks (estradiol, CBC, CMP, bone density baseline if long-term use anticipated). Telemedicine visit after labs for review.
Side Effects Discussed: Joint pain, arthralgia, bone density reduction with long-term use, hot flashes, fatigue, mood changes, elevated cholesterol.
Contraindications Reviewed: Severe osteoporosis, premenopausal use without close monitoring, hypersensitivity to anastrozole or excipients.`;

const SILDENAFIL_RX = `Sildenafil Therapy:
Sexual Health
Follow up labs and telemedicine consult in approximately 3 months. Labs to be drawn as instructed in email to follow. Care team will arrange subsequent lab testing and follow ups. If follow up labs are abnormal, repeat labs per company protocol prior to follow up consultation.
PDE5 Inhibitor Therapy: Reviewed mechanism of action and how the medication prolongs the effect of cGMP by inhibiting its degradation by the enzyme PDE5. In the penis, PDE5 inhibitors prolong erections and increase sexual satisfaction. Patient has been counseled that ED is a risk marker for underlying cardiovascular disease and other health conditions that may warrant further evaluation and treatment by his PCP. Consideration of the benefits of lifestyle modifications have been discussed. Discussion of potential side effects included (but are not limited to): back pain, cold-like symptoms, dizziness, flushing, headache, limb pain, indigestion, myalgia, priapism, tinnitus, vision changes.
Contraindications reviewed: hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, angina, MI within the past 90 days, stroke within the past 6 months, aortic stenosis, penile deformities, nitrate use or alpha blocker use, sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, leukemia.
Potential at home treatments for priapism: Watch and wait, walking or jogging in place, applying ice packs and pressure on the perineum. If no contraindications, pseudoephedrine 60-120mg and diphenhydramine 25mg. If rescue efforts are ineffective and the erection has been present for 4 hours and/or is painful, the patient should immediately visit the ER for further evaluation and treatment.`;
